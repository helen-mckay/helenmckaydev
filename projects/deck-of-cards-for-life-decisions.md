 I have a fascination with playing cards and all the math involved with them.
  It fits in the palm of your hand and yet with shuffling just a few times you
  get an order of the deck you have (more likely than not) never seen before in
  your life.


  What rich possibilities it represents!


  So, I let that be my muse for this project: an application in which you fill out how you want the cards to be read for you and then use the deck to make decisions in your life. Such as, "what's for dinner?"


  Mostly just for "what's for dinner?"
