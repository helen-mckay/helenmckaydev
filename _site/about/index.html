    <h1>About Me</h1>
<!-- Helen's history with web develpment -->
<p>I've been making websites for over 5 years. When I was 13 years old, I taught myself HTML and CSS so I could tweak Tumblr themes, and I have been hooked on web development ever since.</p>
<p>I started making simple sites with pure HTML and CSS, then moved to larger applications in React. Most recently, I've been learning the Jamstack and exploring how to use finite state machines for UX state management. I am currently using 11ty, Netlify, Netlify CMS, and Robot.</p>
<p>I would like to work on sites and applications that could transform the lives of my fellow Houstonians.</p>
<!-- Helen's non-web-dev interets -->
<p>I'm currently studying Computer Science at the University of Houston, and minoring in Mathematics. When not studying or making websites, I can be found bicycling, exploring Houston on the METRO, or reading.</p>
<p>The next version of this site will include a blog where I will share more of my thoughts, philosophy, and lessons learned.</p>
