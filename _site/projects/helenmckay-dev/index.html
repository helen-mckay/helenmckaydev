        My web development portfolio site. Made with 11ty, Netlify CMS, and Netlify. 

I learned a lot from this project, specifically the value of having a defined workflow (something I sorely lacked in all my previous attempts at making this site). I am realizing now that head knowledge was only getting me about 50% of the way there, before. I needed the other 50%: a plan. No wonder that my websites before all felt only 50% done!

From a project management standpoint, it was absolutely beautiful. My Software Engineering professor would have been so proud. 

* made a requirements document
* broke down the entire project into well-defined chunks (that were in turn broken down into many small tasks)

  * requirements document
  * site skeleton
  * back-end
  * sample content
  * wireframes
  * apply styling
  * launch site
  * test site
  * tweak site
  * connect to domain
* assigned a due-date for each chunk and then put all the chunks on a kanban board I made on my whiteboard. 
* then, each day I assigned a set block of time to work on the current chunk for the site, while tracking the time spent so I could see how long it actually took me to do each chunk
