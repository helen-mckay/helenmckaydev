    <h3>a toy that lets you guide your life with a deck of cards</h3>

    <p>I have a fascination with playing cards and all the math involved with them.
It fits in the palm of your hand and yet with shuffling just a few times you
get an order of the deck you have (more likely than not) never seen before in
your life.</p>
<p>What rich possibilities it represents!</p>
<p>So, I let that be my muse for this project: an application in which you fill out how you want the cards to be read for you and then use the deck to make decisions in your life. Such as, &quot;what's for dinner?&quot;</p>
<p>Mostly just for &quot;what's for dinner?&quot;</p>
