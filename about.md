# About Me

When I was 13 years old, I taught myself HTML and CSS so I could tweak Tumblr themesâ€”and I've been hooked on web development ever since. It's been almost 10 years, now, and I've never lost that sense of child-like wonder I felt the very first time I changed a .css file.

Over time my interests shifted from first pure HTML and CSS, to JavaScript and jQuery, to React, to now finite state machines and the Jamstack.

I've built all kinds of projects with all kinds of tools. [You can view them all here](../projects).

I was born-and-raised in the Houston area. I love my city deeply and am eager to use my abilities in web development to give back however I can.

When not making websites, I can be found cooking, reading, trampolining, bicycling, or exploring Houston on the METRO. I'm also always seeking ways to optimize my time management systems, which I will blog about here occasionally.
