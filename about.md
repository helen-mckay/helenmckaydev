# About Me

<!-- Helen's history with web develpment -->

I have been making websites for over 5 years. When I was 13 years old, I taught myself HTML and CSS so I could tweak Tumblr themes, and I have been hooked on web development ever since. 

I started making simple sites with pure HTML and CSS, then moved to larger applications in React. Most recently, I've been learning the JAMstack and exploring how to use finite state machines for UX state management. I am currently using 11ty, Netlify, Netlify CMS, and Robot.

<!-- Helen's non-web-dev interets -->

When not studying for my CS classes or making websites, I can be found bicycling or reading.

Currently reading:
- "How to Listen to Jazz" by Ted Gioia
- "The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul" by Douglas Adams

<!-- What Helen is interested in working in -->

I would like to make web applications that improve the lives of fellow Houstonians.
