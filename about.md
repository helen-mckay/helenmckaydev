# About Me

When I was 13 years old, I taught myself HTML and CSS so I could tweak Tumblr themes—and I've been hooked on web development ever since. It's been almost 10 years, now, and I've never lost that sense of child-like wonder I felt the very first time I changed a .css file.

Over time my interests shifted from first pure HTML and CSS, to JavaScript and jQuery, to React, to now finite state machines and the Jamstack.

I was born-and-raised in the Houston area. I love my city deeply and am eager to use my experience in web development to give back however I can.

When not making websites, I can be found cooking, reading, trampolining, bicycling, or exploring Houston on the METRO. 

I'm always seeking to learn and try new things—from time-management strategies to mindfulness practices to reimagining state-management in web development. I'll blog about it all on this site.
