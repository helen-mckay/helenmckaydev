My very first blog post! How neat!

After working on this site off-and-on for the better part of the year, it feels good to finally launch it. This site was made with 11ty, Netlify CMS, and hosted with Netlify.

This post was made by logging into the Netlify CMS backend of this site. I hope to make many more blog posts in the future, detailing what I've learned along the way in my web developer journey.
