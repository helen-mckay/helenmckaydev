# I'm Helen McKay.

I'm a web developer with a deep love of JavaScript, the Jamstack, and finite state machines. Graduating from the University of Houston in December 2023 with a Bachelor's in Computer Science and minor in Mathematics.

I've been making websites for almost 10 years, now. Nowadays, I make a lot of web apps, mostly about my home city of Houston, Texas. 

## I've worked with...
- HTML5
- CSS3
    - Flexbox
    - Grid
- CSS frameworks and libraries
    - Tailwind
    - SASS
    - Bootstrap
- JavaScript
    - Vanilla
    - jQuery
    - React
    - Node
- Finite state machines
    - Robot
    - XState
- 11ty
- Netlify
- Netlify CMS
- Firebase

## I'm interested in...
