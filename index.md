<!-- blurb of who Helen is -->

# I'm Helen McKay.

I'm a front-end developer studying Computer Science at the University of Houston.

I've been making websites for over 5 years, from small sites in pure HTML and CSS to React applications to the Jamstack (my current interest).

Graduating December 2023 with a Bachelor's in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics. After that, planning on working as a front-end developer or software engineer in the Houston area.

## This very site...

...was made with 11ty and Netlify CMS, and hosted with Netlify. 

This site isn't flashy, but it is fully CRUD (thanks to its Netlify CMS back-end), it is lightweight (under 5kB), it is accessible, and it is <em>fast</em> (perfect scores on Lighthouse!).

## I also know
