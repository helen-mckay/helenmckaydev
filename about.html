<div id="about-text">
    <p>
        I taught myself HTML and CSS when I was 13 years old, and I've been in love with web development ever since.
    </p>
    <p>
        I've made all kinds of sites over the years, from simple HTML + CSS, to React.js apps, to (my current interest) Jamstack sites (like this one!).
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm passionate about responsive design and reimagining app state management through the use of finite state machines.
    </p>

    <p>I've worked with: HTML5, CSS3 (Flexbox, Grid), Vanilla.js, React.js, Javascript finite state machines (Robot, XState), Eleventy, Netlify, Netlify CMS, Git, AWS, Heroku, Firebase, and Adobe XD.</p>
