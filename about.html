    <p>
        I taught myself HTML and CSS when I was 13 years old, and I've been in love with web development ever since.
    </p>
    <p>
        I've made all kinds of sites over the years, from simple HTML + CSS, to React.js apps, to (my current interest) Jamstack sites (like this one!).
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm passionate about responsive and accessible design and reimagining app state management through the use of finite state machines.
