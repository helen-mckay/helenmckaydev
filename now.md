# What I'm up to right now*

<!-- web dev, life, school, employment -->

- Designing, building, testing, and launching the new version of this site (11ty and Netlify CMS this time)
- Studying hard to do as well as possible in my Computer Science classes
- Preparing for applying for summer 2022 internship
- Trying to get back in the habit of bike riding regularly
- Incorporating kanban boards and Cal Newport-style time blocking for time management
- Making more examples of finite state machines implementations on CodePen
- Testing if my hypotheses of using finite state machines in the Jamstack hold any water
- Reading "How to Listen to Jazz" by Ted Gioia
- Watching all of <em>House, M.D.</em>
