# What I'm up to right now*
March 2022:
- Launching latest version of helenmckay.dev (11ty and Netlify CMS, this time)
- Focusing on finishing the spring semester strong (taking Discrete Math and Operating Systems)
- Getting back into reading regularly
- Getting back into bike riding as the weather warms up
- Getting back on the bullet journaling wagon (I've still been journaling each day but have fallen behind on trackers)
- Testing new ways of tracking goals and assigning them as tasks each day in my bullet journal
- Still weighing if I want to apply to internships this summer, or if I want to spend the summer focused on building my portfolio with projects (will definitely be aiming for an internship next summer though). It's so close to summer already that opportunities are going to be limited, anyways, though
