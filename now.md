# What I'm up to right now*
April 2022:
- Launching latest version of helenmckay.dev (11ty and Netlify CMS)
- Focusing on finishing the spring semester strong (taking Discrete Math and Operating Systems)
- Getting back into reading regularly
- Getting back into bike riding as the weather warms up
- Testing new ways of tracking goals in bullet journal
